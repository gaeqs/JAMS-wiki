# Labels

The "labels" tools shows information about the labels used by the assembler to generate the simulation.

![Information](/img/docs/nodes/labels.png)

## Functionalities

Labels are catalogued by files. Each label contains its address, its declaration line and its references.

Each reference contains the address where the label was referenced, the file line of the reference and the file itself.

You can open the context menu by clicking with the secondary mouse button on a label or reference. Here, you can show
the memory dress in the instruction visualizer or in the memory tool.
