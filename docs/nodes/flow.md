## Functionalities

The tool has a visual functionality: it does not allow editing any aspect of the simulation.

You can use the slider to change the column size.

### Cycle number

The visualizer represents a maximum number of instructions. This number is by default 100, and it can be changed in the
configuration.

The cycle number at the upper-right of the tool represents the **first cycle** represented by the tool.

Each column contains a number that represents their cycle regarding the first cycle.

### Movement

You can move through the visualizer dragging the mouse.
