## Functionalities

### Seven-segment display

A seven-segment display allows an easy representation of a digit or letter.
It is controlled by the content of a byte in the memory.

Specifically, each display's segment is controlled by a bit inside that byte. Those bits are the following:

<center>
    <SevenSegmentDisplay/>
</center>

For example, to represent the digit `5` in the display, the value `0b01101101` must be saved in the
display's address.

<center>
    <SevenSegmentDisplayExample/>
</center>

The default memory address of both displays are the address `0xffff0010` for the right display and the address
`0xffff0011` for the left display.
These values can be modified in the configuration, on the `Simulation > MIPS` section.

### Hexadecimal keyboard

The second component is a hexadecimal keyboard.
This keyboard allows the user to input values the simulation can interprete.

When the user clicks one of the buttons, JAMS generates a level 3 hardware exception.
The application can interprete the event creating an interrupt handler at default address `0x80000260`.

To know which buttons are selected, the default memory addresses `0xffff0013` and `0xffff0014` must be read.
Each bit of both bytes represents a keyboard button.
If a bit is enabled, the button is selected.

For example, if the value at address `0xffff0013` is `0b00000100` and the value at address
`0xffff0014` is `0b10000100`, buttons 2, A and F are selected.

### Interrupt generator

This tool allows generating two interruption types: software interrupts and hardware interrupts.

Software interrupts inform the application about errors and exceptions on the simulation.
This kind of interrupts must contain a **cause** the application can read implementing an interrupt handler.

Hardware interruptions inform the application about events generated from external components attached to the
simulator.
These interruptions are defined by a level between 2 and 63 (level 1 is reserved for software interrupts and level 0
represents the no-interrupt state).
The level is used to calculate the entry point of the interrupt handler.

:::info Entry points

Interrupt handlers' entry points are calculated using the interrupt level and the COP0 parameters
`IntCtl/VS` (1 by default) and `EBase` (0 by default).

The entry point is calculated using the following formula:

`address = EBase + offset & 0x3fffffff | 0x80000000`

Where `offset` is, depending on the interruption:
<ul>
    <li>Software interrupt: 0x180</li>
    <li>Cache error: 0x100</li>
    <li>Hardware interrupt: 0x200 + level * VS * 32</li>
</ul>

### Counter

The counter is a small tool that generates level 2 hardware interrupts every number of cycles.
This number can be assigned from the tool or writing a byte on the default memory address `0xffff0012`.
