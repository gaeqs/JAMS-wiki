# Creating a project

The first time you run JAMS it will show the following window:

![Main Window](/img/docs/getting-started/mainWindow.png)

Here we can find four sections:

- **Projects**: in this section we can find the most recent projects. We can also open an existing project.
- **New project**: allows us to create new projects.
- **Configuration**: shows the configuration window.
- **About**: shows basic information about JAMS.

If we select "**new project**", the following screen will appear:

![Main Window New Project](/img/docs/getting-started/mainWindowNewProject.png)

Here we can create our first project.

The first thing we have to do is to select the project type we want. By default, JAMS only includes the MIPS project
type. Plugin may add new project types.

:::tip Invalid parameters

JAMS doesn't allow us to create a new project if any of the parameters is invalid. Invalid parameters are shown in red.

:::

Once we click the create button, JAMS will create the project, and we will be moved to the developing environment.
