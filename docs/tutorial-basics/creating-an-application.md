# Creating an application

Once we have a project created, we can start developing our application.

## Creating files

We can create new files using the `explorer` tool. The first time we open this tool we will find the project's main
folder. Inside it, we find the simulation file's folder. As the name guesses, the simulation will create its files
inside this foldr.

If we use the secondary mouse button on the project's main folder, JAMS will open the explorer's context menu. We can
create a new assembly file using  `New > Assembly file`.

:::tip Files to assemble

When we create a new assembly file, JAMS will ask you whether it should add the file into the "files to assemble" list.
JAMS will only assemble the files inside thi list. These files will appear into the explorer with a green background.
You can add or remove files from the list using the explorer's context menu.

Once created, we can open the file in the editor and start developing.
